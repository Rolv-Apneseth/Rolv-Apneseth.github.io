# Rolv-Apneseth.github.io

My developer portfolio, hosted on GitHub Pages [here](https://rolv-apneseth.github.io/)

## Description

This is my first developer portfolio, made without the use of any big libraries such as JQuery or Bootstrap. Instead, I used only plain HTML, SASS (CSS preprocessor) and a touch of JavaScript. The contact form uses [Formscpree](https://formspree.io/) as the site is static (so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages).

Make sure to check out the site!
